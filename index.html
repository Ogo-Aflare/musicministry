            <h2>About Me</a>
            <h5>Minister of <span>The Gospel</span></h5>
            <p>OKUNOLA OGOOLUWA, a dedicated gospel minister,
                 born, into a devout Christian home in Lagos,
                 Nigeria. From an early age, I was immersed
                 in the teachings of the Bible, nutured by
                 unwavering faith and example of my parents, who
                 are founders of THE HERALD OF CHRIST'S COMING MINISTRIES, a Bible 
                 believing church. At a very young age I started serving as the church
                 instrumentalist, advanced in musical knowledge and 
                 learnt to play some musical instruments. I realized 
                 my calling into singing ministry briefly after joining and 
                 also serving under Beyond Music Network, a body founded
                 by Evangelist Samuel Onwona with the assignment to win
                 souls to the body of Christ through Music. I have by
                 the grace and inspiration of God written some songs
                 which are available on some streaming platforms.
                 My primary assignment as one who has been called into this ministry,
                 is to affect lives, and bring people into the light.

                <p>Available to Use was inspired by God through the theme 
                    of Beyond Music conference 2022 and a strong desire to be 
                    usable and durable vessels for God. Amos and I were featured
                    by Beyond Music Network in production. It is a blessing.

                    <p>It was a very odd night I couldn't sleep, then 
                        suddenly, the thought of how far God has brought me,
                        then I wrote the chorus, recorded it on my phone then I was able to sleep. 
                        BOA was featured in this song. 
                        Listen and dance to God for all He has done, we can only say "Daddy Ese!"

                <h5>Awi Mayehun</h5> <div class="pra">
                <p>Awi Mayehun is a short chorus I composed during
                    a rehearsal at my church.  While we were all together,
                    I was thinking about what dimension of God I've experienced,
                    and then I remember how often I see Him fulfill His promises 
                    in my life.
